# Notes App

This app is to explore new technologies through the implementation of a notes app.

## TODO:
- Discover how to store note data in mongo db. Proposed initial note information we should store:
    - content - string
    - createdBy - date
- Create endpoints for creating, updating, and deleting a note
- Create endpoint to fetch all notes
